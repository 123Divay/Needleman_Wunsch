# Needleman_Wunsch Algorithm
# Introduction :-
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm that is used in bioinformatics to align DNA or protein sequences. It involves the use of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is
used to find the optimal global alignment, and essentially divides a larger problem into a series of smaller problems to find this optimal alignment.
